Project needs to go on hiatus for a bit until lab computers are open.

Next steps:

1 - Make the coop coevolution models log each individual generated
2 - Make the graphs track actual amount of individuals generated, so we can accurately compare coop coevolution to the other models
3 - Replicate the results on 5-10 runs so we know they werent a fluke, implementing a system to make this run on multiple systems in parallel could help with this
