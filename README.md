Evolving a hexapod gait using a GA. In this project, this was done by evolving each leg as its own individual population (.../Mantis GA Individual Legs) and evolving each gait as a whole (.../Mantis GA). This was done again with one leg disabled, for each leg, in both the individual leg evolution model (.../Leg x Disabled/Individual Legs) and whole gait evolution model (.../Leg x Disabled/Original).
